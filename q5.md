a)
    In the first Approach, we are creating a empty list and then we are appending the list to add the values. Once the list is created, then we call the list to print     the values stored in list.

    In the Second approach, we have a comprehension list which is created on the time of printing. The values are apppended in to the list and once, the list is ready     then the values are printed on the screen.

    In the third approach, we have no list created. we, simply, create a function that return the values and then we use those returned values for printing. This way      we can save on the memory by avoiding the creation of list.

b)
The third approach is better and more memory efficient as we are avoiding creating list and directly using the value by calling the function.
